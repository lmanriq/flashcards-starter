# Abstract

This is a quiz game that allow you to answer questions via the command line in the Node.js runtime environment. After each question, you will receive feedback indicating whether or not your guess was correct. Once you answer all of the questions, you will receive feedback regarding the percentage of questions you answered correctly and the time it took you to complete the quiz. You will then be prompted to retry the questions that you got wrong the first time.
